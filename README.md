# Java Fundamentals
### Author: James Dansie
This directory is for the CF 401d6 Java. This will repo will go over the java fundamentals.
### Basics (Lab1)
The basics is going over the basic (big surprise bu-dump-dish). In particular it is focused on how to declare a function with return types. So far everything is static so we don't have to instanciate anything.
### Arrays, Loops (Lab2)
The lab for today is going over arrays, loops, and writing tests. Apparently inteliJ can sometimes lose connection to grandle, so to re-sync - click the "gradle" in the top left hand corner and click the circle made of arrows. Also, for float tests you need to include the amount of difference that is okay. For example a test might be 1.000000 == 1.0000001, these are pretty much the same, so the difference allows us to so "anything less than this and we'll just say these are equal".
### Lab 03: Maps, File I/O, and Testing
This lab is going over hashmaps, hashsets, and builds a linter for checking js files. We also use a lot of scanners to read files, and check the characters.
